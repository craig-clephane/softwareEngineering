# Software Engineering
## Group 3A

This is our team git repo to store all work throughout the workshops for the software engineering module. Work will need to be carried out in the `develop` branch, and then a pull request will need to be made where two people approve the request before it can be merged into `master`.  This way we can include peer review in our work and ensure that the code we write is up to the highest standard.
